1. [Am I Responsive](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) website has been used to test the website responsiveness in various and devices.

2. Desktop: This website has been tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers where all links to the pages, responsive table and forms and the footer icons are working well.

3. Mobile: This website has been tested in mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy A8+) where all links to the pages, responsive table and forms and the footer icons are working well. I also tested mobile responsiveness in other models of handphones by using options that is available in Chrome DevTools.

4. I have tested if the website are serving the purpose of the creation by gathering opinions from family, friends and my mentor.

5. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page.
    2. Try to submit the empty form and there is a message appeared as "Please fill out this field" which prevent client from submitting empty form.
    3. Try to submit the form with a proper email address syntax and there is a message appeared as "Please include an @ in the email address".
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and the submit button works by redirecting back to home page for this project as the submit button was not linked to any server for the moment.

5. Unsolved Issues: Unable to settle it before submission due to the time constraint to figure out the solution.

    1. The width of header element does not align with the sections and footer which create the white spacing for the sections and footers.

    2. When I clicked on the nav item on the section that I want to view, it does not direct me to the header of the section but to the content directly which is not the way I want it to be.
