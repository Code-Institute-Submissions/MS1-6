5. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page.
    2. Try to submit the empty form and there is a message appeared as "Please fill out this field" which prevent client from submitting empty form.
    3. Try to submit the form with a proper email address syntax and there is a message appeared as "Please include an @ in the email address".
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and the submit button works by redirecting back to home page for this project as the submit button was not linked to any server for the moment.

6. Unsolved Issues: Unable to settle it before submission due to the time constraint to figure out the solution.

    1. The width of header element does not align with the sections and footer which create the white spacing for the sections and footers.

    2. When I clicked on the nav item on the section that I want to view, it does not direct me to the header of the section but to the content directly which is not the way I want it to be.
